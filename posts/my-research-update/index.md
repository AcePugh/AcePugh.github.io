## Current Research Focus

I'm excited to share an update on my ongoing research projects at USDA-ARS. This summer has been particularly productive, with several exciting developments in our work applying remote sensing and AI to agricultural challenges.

### Drone-Based Crop Monitoring

Our team has been deploying small unoccupied aircraft systems (sUAS) to monitor crop health and predict yield outcomes. Recent flights over sorghum and peanut fields have generated high-resolution multispectral imagery that we're using to:

- Estimate biomass accumulation
- Detect early signs of drought stress
- Predict final yield weeks before harvest

### Machine Learning Pipeline Development

I've been developing new machine learning models that can process satellite imagery alongside drone data to provide more robust crop predictions. The preliminary results are promising, showing improved accuracy when combining multiple remote sensing platforms.

### Collaboration Opportunities

I'm always looking for new collaboration opportunities! If you're working in:
- Precision agriculture
- Remote sensing applications
- Machine learning for crop science
- Plant breeding programs

Please don't hesitate to reach out. I believe the best science happens when we work together across disciplines and institutions.

## What's Next

Looking ahead to the fall, we'll be:
1. Expanding our drone monitoring to additional crop species
2. Publishing our latest findings on drought stress detection
3. Beginning a new project on automated pest detection using computer vision

Stay tuned for more updates as these projects develop!
