        I'm a postdoctoral research scientist at the USDA-ARS. My mission is to use remote sensing and artificial intelligence tools to augment the breeding and production of key crop species.

        I use a wide range of remote sensing tools such as small unoccupied aircraft systems (sUAS), or "drones", satellite imagery, and field-based proximal sensors. Once these data are collected, I use machine learning techniques to estimate or predict key traits including yield, drought tolerance, quality, and more.
