#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving #the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key #parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

   # summary: |
   #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity #in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming #tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
