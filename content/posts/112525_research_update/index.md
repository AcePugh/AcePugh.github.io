## Update

All experiments have been harvested, now it's just time for data analysis and to begin planning for next summer!

### Collaboration Opportunities

Reminder: I'm always looking for new collaboration opportunities! If you're working in:
- Agronomics
- Cotton genetics or production
- Abiotic stress tolerance
- Plant breeding programs

Please don't hesitate to reach out. I believe the best science happens when we work together across disciplines.
