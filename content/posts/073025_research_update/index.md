## Update

We recently placed out some infrared thermometers, or IRT, into the material. These will give us canopy temperature data throughout the day and be very useful for studying abiotic (heat and drought) stress.

We are hoping temperatures will stay high and rainfall will diminish in August so that we observe differences between the cotton that received full irrigation vs. reduced irrigation.

### Collaboration Opportunities

Reminder: I'm always looking for new collaboration opportunities! If you're working in:
- Agronomics
- Cotton genetics or production
- Abiotic stress tolerance
- Plant breeding programs

Please don't hesitate to reach out. I believe the best science happens when we work together across disciplines.
